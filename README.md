Ruby w/ Passenger Phusion
=========================

**DEPRECATED**: *This project is now deprecated. It was meant as small
base image for deploying [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)
applications with Docker and Kubernetes. We now recommend using
[ruby](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby) base images and run applications
with [Puma](https://puma.io).*

*The code will remain as an example for how to build small images for
complicated software like Phusion Passenger*
